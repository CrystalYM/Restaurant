### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Crystal
#### I am full-stack React developer with interest in modern ux/ui design.
I made this project to practice my React skills a bit more. The page was made in reference to a figma design that has had  practice sites built from it, so it was the most suitable incase I needed help with a particular part.
